<h1>Aldridge Group 8" Incandescent</h1>
<h4>Manufactured: 1980's, 1990's? (Unsure - an estimate)</h4>
<p>Compared to its 12" counterpart, Aldridge Group 8" incandescent signals are very rare.<br>The only known installation currently in use is at the Charlton Traffic School in Victoria.<br>The only known former installation is at the intersection of James Ruse Dr/Hassall St, Rosehill, NSW - Most likely there were more installations of these lights that weren't documented.</p>
<p>These lights are made of plastic and have a bulbous back. They use 240vac bulbs with no transformer inside. The metal target board is also a unique design.</p>

<td colspan="4">Above images from my own collection.<br>Due to a design flaw, the top door of this light can't be opened fully - Not sure if this defect applies to other lights of this kind.<br>I believe other lights of this type have a more glossy reflector, unlike the one pictured.</td>
