<h1>Aldridge Traffic Systems 8" "Durasig" halogen</h1>
<h4>Manufactured: Late 1970's & 1980's</h4>
<p>One of the 3 oldest styles of ATS incandescent lights. These are made from plastic, and look identical to Durasig traffic lights, which I believe are the predecessor to these lights. The lenses have the 'ATS' logo embossed in the centre.</p>
<p>Looking from the front, these look identical to the other 3 ATS light designs from this era.<br>I have not been able to find any examples of a 12" variant.</p>

<p>I currently do not have many images of these lights, although I will add new ones once more photos are taken. :P
