<h1>Aldridge Clear LEDs - Revision 2</h1>
<h4>Manufactured: 2001</h4>
<p>The second version of clear LED lights from Aldridge - These are simply standalone modules that were retrofitted into existing ATS & AWA housings in Victoria.</p>
<p>The only light variants made were ball signals and arrow signals - No 12" variants wre made either.</p>
<p>The intersections with these lights present are all on Westall Rd, Springvle, VIC, at seven intersections, listed at the bottom of the page. These were installed around the time of the Westall Rd level crossing removal project's completion, in 2001.</p>
<p>All lights of this version use cutaway/scoop visors exclusively.</p>
